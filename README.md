Sources (.csv) → Bronze Layer (tables) → Silver Layer (tables) → Gold Layer (views) → Consumption (BI & Reporting, Ad-Hoc Querying , Machine Learning)  

- 📄 Sources: .csv files containing the raw data.  
- 🥉 Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.     
- 🥈 Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.     
- 🥇 Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
